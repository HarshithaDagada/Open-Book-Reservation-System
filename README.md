The Open Book Reservation System is a web-based application designed to facilitate the reservation and management of books in a library. This project is developed using Java Servlets for the server-side logic, JDBC for database connectivity, and MySQL as the database management system. The application allows users to search for books, make reservations, and manage their reservations, while administrators can manage book inventory and view user activities.
